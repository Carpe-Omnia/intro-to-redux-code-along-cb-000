# Intro to Redux: Reading Data from State 

## Objectives

* Set up the basic Redux architecture
* Use `Provider` to make  `store` available to your components
* Use `connect` and `mapStateToProps` to pass data from the store's state to your components
* Use an action creator function to dispatch an action that puts data in state.

## Introduction

In this code along, we'll be building a simple shopping list application that will allow a user to view an existing shopping list. 

Clone down this repo and run `npm install` to get started. 

### Step 1: Setting Up The Store

First things first, we'll use Redux to initialize our store and pass it down to your top-level container component.
